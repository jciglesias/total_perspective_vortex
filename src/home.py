"""\"The Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the whole Universe on the principle of
extrapolated matter analyses. To explain — since every piece of matter in the Universe
is in some way affected by every other piece of matter in the Universe, it is in theory
possible to extrapolate the whole of creation — every sun, every planet, their orbits,
their composition and their economic and social history from, say, one small piece of
fairy cake. The man who invented the Total Perspective Vortex did so basically in order
to annoy his wife. Trin Tragula — for that was his name — was a dreamer, a thinker, a
speculative philosopher or, as his wife would have it, an idiot. And she would nag him
incessantly about the utterly inordinate amount of time he spent staring out into space,
or mulling over the mechanics of safety pins, or doing spectrographic analyses of pieces
of fairy cake. “Have some sense of proportion!” she would say, sometimes as often as
thirty-eight times in a single day. And so he built the Total Perspective Vortex — just
to show her. And into one end he plugged the whole of reality as extrapolated from a
piece of fairy cake, and into the other end he plugged his wife: so that when he turned it
on she saw in one instant the whole infinity of creation and herself in relation to it. To
Trin Tragula’s horror, the shock completely annihilated her brain; but to his satisfaction
he realized that he had proved conclusively that if life is going to exist in a Universe of
this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion.\"
